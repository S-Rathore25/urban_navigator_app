# Project Description: Personal Urban Navigator & Accessibility Assistant
The "Personal Urban Navigator & Accessibility Assistant" is an innovative, AI-powered mobile application designed to revolutionize urban mobility by providing highly personalized and accessible navigation for everyone. Traditional navigation apps often overlook the diverse needs of individuals with mobility, sensory, or cognitive challenges, leading to significant barriers in urban environments.

Our solution moves beyond generic routing. It integrates a user's unique accessibility profile (e.g., wheelchair access, stair avoidance, crowd sensitivity) with real-time urban data, including live traffic, public transport status, and temporary obstacles. Leveraging advanced AI/ML algorithms on a robust Flask backend, the app calculates the most accessible and comfortable routes, dynamically adjusting based on current conditions and user preferences.

The app also features a community crowdsourcing module, enabling users to report real-time accessibility information (like broken ramps or new accessible entrances). This user-contributed data is validated with AI-assisted computer vision and NLP, continuously enriching the map's accuracy. Built with Flutter for a seamless cross-platform experience and utilizing OpenStreetMap data, this project aims to empower individuals with greater independence, reduce urban navigation stress, and foster truly inclusive and smarter cities for all.
